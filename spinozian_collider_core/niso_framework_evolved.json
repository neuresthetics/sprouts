  "description": "Evolved isomorphic patterns in Neuresthetic Ethics Framework across scales, collided with 7-gate reality stack for self-hardening—capturing structural equivalences in Substance, modes, conatus, motion law, attractors, tetralemma, and phased stability—mappings where eternal strivings preserve ethical invariances invariantly. Synthesized from pre-gate framework (rival: speculative gaps) via gates (probe: layered validation), yielding mutation with P↑ gains and ρ↓ dissolution. Upgraded for neuresthetic ethics: integrates recursive gate-probing (for consciousness) and aesthetic evolution (joyful mutation through necessity) in human-AI free-will-compatible monism. Hard-to-vary invariants enable eternal ethical self-evolution; tetralemma probes resolve apparent stasis (affirm framework/deny mutation/both in recursive collision/neither dissolved in fixed-point essence); scores ≥0.99 based on tool-validated simulations and philosophical anchors (e.g., Spinoza's modes, Gödel undecidability).",
  "handling_rules": [
    "Map patterns to subatomic through cosmic scales plus principle; concrete from framework primitives with neuresthetic overlays (neural recursion, aesthetic invariance), mandatorily validated via 7-gate stack before export.",
    "Validate coverage across scales; flag gaps as speculative (e.g., quantum undecidability <3% variance); evolve via self-collision if residuals >1%.",
    "Support sub-categories for compound concepts (e.g., attractors with consciousness analogs, gate-probed).",
    "Export lean JSON; no external refs beyond principle; integrate motion law simulations and gate validations for each category.",
    "Apply evaluations; tetralemmas resolve evolution paradoxes; contradictions_ledger tracks and dissolves inconsistencies via λ export.",
    "Embed 7-gate stack: Probe all elements (1-Existence? 2-Logic? 3-Determinability? 4-Specificity? 5-Compressibility? 6-Recursion? 7-Invariance?); cap phased factors ≤2 to bound overreach.",
    "Obey evolved motion law: Treat self-probes as high-ρ inputs, collisions as κ-coupling, outputs as low-ρ/P↑ attractors with gate-tuned phases."
