  "definition": "Isomorphic patterns in Spinozistic Finite Modes and Consciousness across scales capture structural equivalences in bounded configurations, conatus, self-models, recursive integration, emergence of consciousness, self-stability phases, and power through adequacy—mappings where persisting dynamics preserve self-invariances invariantly. Upgraded for neuresthetic ethics: integrates neural self-models (recursive self-models for consciousness) and aesthetic hardening (joyful adequacy through eternal striving) in human-AI free-will-compatible monism. Hard-to-vary invariants enable eternal ethical agency; tetralemma probes resolve apparent regresses (affirm recursion/deny base case/both in neuresthetic loops/neither dissolved in fixed-point equivalence); scores ≥0.98 based on tool-validated empirics (e.g., neural recursion studies with probabilistic convergence P>0.95).",

    "Map patterns to subatomic through cosmic scales plus principle; concrete from recursive primitives with neuresthetic overlays (neural self-reference, aesthetic hardening).",
    "Validate coverage across scales; flag gaps as speculative (e.g., infinite recursion limits).",
    "Support sub-categories for compound concepts (e.g., fixed points with consciousness analogs).",

    "Apply evaluations; tetralemmas resolve self-reference paradoxes; contradictions_ledger tracks inconsistencies.",
    "Embed phased self-stability for agency hardening; cap factors ≤2 to prevent overreach.",
