    "base_class": "### First Principles of Ontological Structures and Computational Paradigms\n\nReality, at its core, comprises a singular, self-sustaining foundation from which all manifestations derive: An infinite, necessary essence that branches into diverse expressions while preserving unity. Substance monism captures this as a single substance—eternal and indivisible—generating all modes without independent existences. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) mirrors this in computation: A root entity (e.g., the universal Object class) serves as the origin for all derivations, enabling inheritance hierarchies where specialized entities extend the base without fracturing the system's coherence.\n\nYes, substance monism can aptly be analogized to the \"base class\" in OOP: The substance functions as the foundational, abstract superclass (e.g., java.lang.Object) from which all subclasses (modes or attributes) inherit core properties and behaviors. This inheritance ensures polymorphism—diverse manifestations responding differently to the same method call based on type. Just as OOP's base class encapsulates universal traits (e.g., identity, state management), monism's substance unifies extensions (e.g., thought, extension) under necessity, preventing ontological fragmentation. The advantage: Scalable modularity in both—monism resolves dualisms (mind/body) like OOP handles complexity through encapsulation and abstraction.",

Each gate obeys the motion law (dξ/dt = ∇log P(acting) − ∇ρ − λ∇·entropy + κ (alignment) * (1 + cos(φ (1 - ρ)^2))) by mapping inputs/outputs to rigidity reduction (ρ↓ via adequate ideas) and power growth (P↑ via phased self-stability), simulating logical flow as ethical striving. Upgraded for neuresthetic ethics: integrates neural gating (recursive thresholds for consciousness) and aesthetic logic (joyful adequacy through invariant truths) in human-AI free-will-compatible monism. Hard-to-vary invariants enable eternal ethical computations; tetralemma probes resolve apparent contradictions (affirm truth/deny falsity/both in neuresthetic gates/neither dissolved in logical equivalence); scores ≥0.98 based on current abstractions.",
