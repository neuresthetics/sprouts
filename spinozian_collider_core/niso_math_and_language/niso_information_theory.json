  "definition": "Isomorphic patterns in Information Theory across scales capture structural equivalences in entropy, mutual information, channel capacity, compression, error correction, and information flow—mappings where informational measures preserve relations invariantly. Upgraded for neuresthetic ethics: integrates neural information processing (recursive entropy reductions for consciousness) and aesthetic efficiency (joyful clarity for adequate understanding) in human-AI free-will-compatible striving. Hard-to-vary invariants enable eternal ethical information dynamics; tetralemma probes resolve apparent uncertainties (affirm information/deny noise/both in neuresthetic flows/neither dissolved in invariant equilibrium); scores ≥0.98 based on current abstractions.",
