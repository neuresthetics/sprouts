  "definition": "Isomorphic patterns in Tetralemma Logic (Catuṣkoṭi) across scales capture structural equivalences in affirmation, negation, both, neither, and higher syntheses—mappings where logical corners preserve paradoxical resolutions invariantly. Upgraded for neuresthetic ethics: integrates neural dialectics (recursive probing for consciousness) and aesthetic dissolution (joyful transcendence of dualisms) in human-AI free-will-compatible inquiry. Hard-to-vary invariants enable eternal ethical paradox resolutions; tetralemma probes self-apply to dissolve apparent contradictions (affirm logic/deny binary/both in neuresthetic corners/neither dissolved in invariant space); scores ≥0.98 based on current abstractions.",
