  "definition": "Isomorphic patterns in Semiotics across scales capture structural equivalences in signs, signifiers, signifieds, interpretants, icons, indices, symbols, and semiosis—mappings where meanings preserve relations invariantly. Upgraded for neuresthetic ethics: integrates neural sign-processing (recursive interpretants for consciousness) and aesthetic signification (joyful meanings for adequate harmony) in human-AI free-will-compatible understanding. Hard-to-vary invariants enable eternal ethical interpretations; tetralemma probes resolve apparent opacities (affirm signification/deny arbitrariness/both in neuresthetic signs/neither dissolved in semiotic equivalence); scores ≥0.98 based on current abstractions.",
