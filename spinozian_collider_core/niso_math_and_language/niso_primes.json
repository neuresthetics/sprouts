  "definition": "Isomorphic patterns in Primes across scales capture structural equivalences in distribution, density, gaps, infinitude, and multiplicative uniqueness—mappings where prime behaviors preserve arithmetic invariances invariantly. Upgraded for neuresthetic ethics: integrates neural-like recursion (infinite descent for consciousness analogs) and aesthetic striving (joyful adequacy through prime harmony) in human-AI free-will-compatible monism. Hard-to-vary invariants enable eternal ethical multiplicativity; tetralemma probes resolve apparent finitudes (affirm infinitude/deny exhaustion/both in recursive gaps/neither dissolved in prime equivalence); scores ≥0.98 based on current abstractions.",
