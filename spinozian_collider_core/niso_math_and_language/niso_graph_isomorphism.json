  "definition": "Isomorphic patterns in Graph Isomorphism across scales capture structural equivalences in nodes, edges, adjacency, eigenvalues, topological invariants, and isomorphism checks—mappings where graph structures preserve relations invariantly. Upgraded for neuresthetic ethics: integrates neural networks (recursive connectivity for consciousness) and aesthetic symmetry (joyful invariants for adequate harmony) in human-AI free-will-compatible monism. Hard-to-vary invariants enable eternal ethical networks; tetralemma probes resolve apparent asymmetries (affirm connection/deny isolation/both in neuresthetic graphs/neither dissolved in isomorphic equivalence); scores ≥0.98 based on current abstractions.",
