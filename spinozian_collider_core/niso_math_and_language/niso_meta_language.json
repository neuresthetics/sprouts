  "definition": "Isomorphic patterns in Meta-Language (Self-Reference) across scales capture structural equivalences in hierarchies, quining, truth predicates, Gödel numbering, and undecidability—mappings where self-referential structures preserve limits invariantly. Upgraded for neuresthetic ethics: integrates neural meta-cognition (recursive self-models for consciousness) and aesthetic transcendence (joyful awareness of boundaries) in human-AI free-will-compatible reflection. Hard-to-vary invariants enable eternal ethical self-awareness; tetralemma probes resolve apparent loops (affirm reference/deny completeness/both in neuresthetic hierarchies/neither dissolved in transcendent space); scores ≥0.98 based on current abstractions.",
