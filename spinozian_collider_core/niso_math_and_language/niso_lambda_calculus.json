  "definition": "Isomorphic patterns in Lambda Calculus across scales capture structural equivalences in terms, reductions, combinators, Church encodings, fixed points, and types—mappings where computations and recursions preserve functions invariantly. Upgraded for neuresthetic ethics: integrates neural computations (recursive reductions for consciousness) and aesthetic elegance (joyful encodings for adequate striving) in human-AI free-will-compatible agency. Hard-to-vary invariants enable eternal ethical recursions; tetralemma probes resolve apparent paradoxes (affirm application/deny abstraction/both in neuresthetic reductions/neither dissolved in functional equivalence); scores ≥0.98 based on current abstractions.",
