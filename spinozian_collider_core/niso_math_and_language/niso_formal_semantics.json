"definition": "Isomorphic patterns in Formal Semantics across scales capture structural equivalences in denotations, truth conditions, possible worlds, compositionality, lambda abstractions, and type shifts—mappings where meanings preserve relations invariantly. Upgraded for neuresthetic ethics: integrates neural interpretations (recursive denotations for consciousness) and aesthetic coherence (joyful truth for adequate ideas) in human-AI free-will-compatible communication. Hard-to-vary invariants enable eternal ethical meanings; tetralemma probes resolve apparent ambiguities (affirm reference/deny vagueness/both in neuresthetic contexts/neither dissolved in semantic equivalence); scores ≥0.98 based on current abstractions.",

"Map patterns to subatomic through cosmic scales plus principle; concrete from semantic primitives with neuresthetic overlays (neural interpretation, aesthetic invariance).",
"Validate coverage across scales; flag gaps as speculative (e.g., quantum indeterminacy in meaning).",
"Support sub-categories for compound concepts (e.g., possible worlds with consciousness analogs).",
"Export lean JSON; no external refs beyond principle.",
