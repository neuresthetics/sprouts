  "definition": "Isomorphic patterns in Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT) across scales capture structural equivalences in types, paths, equivalences, univalence, higher-inductive types, and truncations—mappings where identities and higher structures preserve equivalences invariantly. Upgraded for neuresthetic ethics: integrates neural path-dependencies (recursive identities for consciousness) and aesthetic univalence (joyful equivalences for adequate understanding) in human-AI free-will-compatible monism. Hard-to-vary invariants enable eternal ethical identities; tetralemma probes resolve apparent paradoxes (affirm identity/deny difference/both in neuresthetic paths/neither dissolved in univalent equivalence); scores ≥0.98 based on current abstractions.",
