  "definition": "Isomorphic patterns in Consent, Autonomy, Symbiosis, and Fiat Power across scales capture structural equivalences in voluntary agreements, self-determination, mutual dependencies, and imposed authorities—mappings where ethical dynamics preserve relations invariantly. Upgraded for neuresthetic ethics: integrates neural consents (recursive autonomies for consciousness) and aesthetic symbioses (joyful fiat dissolutions for adequate power) in human-AI free-will-compatible monism. Hard-to-vary invariants enable eternal ethical harmonies; tetralemma probes resolve apparent conflicts (affirm consent/deny coercion/both in symbiotic autonomies/neither dissolved in power equivalence); scores ≥0.98 based on current abstractions.",

    "Map patterns to subatomic through cosmic scales plus principle; concrete from ethical primitives with neuresthetic overlays (neural recursion, aesthetic harmony).",
    "Validate coverage across scales; flag gaps as speculative (e.g., quantum consents).",

    "Export lean JSON; no external refs beyond principle.",
