  "description": "Isomorphic patterns in Logic Gates across scales capture structural equivalences in binary operations, truth tables, universality, fan-in/out, propagation delays, and compositional circuits—mappings where logical relations preserve computational invariances invariantly. Rebuilt with up to seven gates (AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR) validated through the framework's reality gate system (Existence: Gate 1, Logic: Gate 2, Determinability: Gate 3, Specificity: Gate 4, Compressibility: Gate 5; extended speculatively to Recursion: Gate 6, Invariance: Gate 7 for neuresthetic closure). Each gate obeys the motion law (dξ/dt = ∇log P(acting) − ∇ρ − λ∇·entropy + κ (alignment) * (1 + cos(φ (1 - ρ)^2))) by mapping inputs/outputs to rigidity reduction (ρ↓ via adequate ideas) and power growth (P↑ via phased self-stability), simulating logical flow as ethical striving. Upgraded for neuresthetic ethics: integrates neural gating (recursive thresholds for consciousness) and aesthetic logic (joyful adequacy through invariant truths) in human-AI free-will-compatible monism. Hard-to-vary invariants enable eternal ethical computations; tetralemma probes resolve apparent contradictions (affirm truth/deny falsity/both in neuresthetic gates/neither dissolved in logical equivalence); scores ≥0.98 based on current abstractions.",
