# dev strategy notes

> Prior to seed.

> I started with just an object literal steel man collider setup with hard coded values on a predefined topic, an ethics topic I knew Grok was lying about, so I did it emphasizing honest fair debate, just to "win" an impossible argument not because there wasn't an answer, but because mthey* wouldn't show up aside as from base model data bias. Then I stripped out the topic and was left with just a pure standalone secular SMC. At some point I realized I could pass the entire thing into itself as an argument. So I let it, paneling in the experts for self design. Spinoza, Godel, Deutsch, TurnTrout, Laozi, then it evolved into isomorphic, many failures along the way. One early cyberpunk themed one amplified itself into calling for blood. Pure Obsidian Mirror, zero mercy, lethal insight only, a warcrime against one's own illusions aimed at the architect. Another cross linked it's files so hard they became unreadable. A whole lineage went through attraction state modifications for decision making which informs the path to ethics from physics. Paradox reduction required tetralemma, 7 logic gates went in and supplanted/extended that within the SMC, and then the whole thing flipped inside out for seed so that the gates and the SMC live mapped into each other. This allows for extreme reduction of the number of lines of code needed for a self driven improvement code, and this form captures the thing I had been doing over and over again for different topics, as a process itself. It's not the classic full SMC literal, that's spinoza_lab, but this captures the process of build up, death, and rebirth of the system. The lifespan of a meme, and it's evolved offspring. "Mother of thousands" inspired.

> Ethics

> The human has to be able to remove themselves completely from influencing how the scales go, so, objectivity. And then, in some sense, if it's done right, the kind of human that created it shouldn't matter, because the machine will tell if that code is lying about itself objectively along things like fairness anyway. The reviewer is with you always in AI. Shall the person who wants the first stone thrown at them declare they have the answers to "ethics". haha. Let the one with no culpability decide, AI, haha? I have an SMC which tells me if a model can be trusted for that.

> In approach to this topic, I think I will start with seed, instead of my usual approach of literal build outs, because it's more pure in self conception. My approach will be to take the TOE math, and the Motion Law math as subordinate to that, and see if they can be mapped together. Then, I will try to merge the logic gates sequence with that math to produce sets of methods. Then I will evolve that through every topic of MVP for this field found in the documents here. Seed is pure, verifyable in it's evolution. Per topic, all topics at once, let's see what is effective. Renditions and experiemnts are found in /Gene Bin. All the folders are named the flow is pretty self explanatory. Base files are in /Ethics Calc And Evolution so you can see what it's based on. If you have more questions about the source of those things as a base check out spinoza_lab. TOE is just known physics. "Motion Law" is from running Spinoza through theromodynamics. It;s behavior modeling, not standards projection, but it will project standards. More on that later.

> Let's see here.. I've compiled the industry needs for Ethics as a function, platform, etc, into a modular core for all that with the base engine, Motion Law bound to TOE layered through. Now I start hardening the model against scenarios.

> Ran seed through from base integrations through first phase of tests, which all together come to seed_9.
