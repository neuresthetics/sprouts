# README: Seed Framework Version 6.0 - Modular Core Evolution

## Overview

The **Seed Framework** is a recursive axiomatic steel man collider designed for synthesizing arguments, ethical dilemmas, physical unifications, and decision processes through logic gates, empirical anchors, and integrated modules. Inspired by Aristotelian entelechy and evolved via self-application, it functions as a self-contained processor for unifying ethics, math, and physics domains. The framework emphasizes coherence, grounding, and harmony attractors (ω₃) while bounding speculation with humility metrics like D(S).

Version 6.0 builds directly on 5.0 by introducing a **modular core** for scalable integration of extensions (e.g., conatus_math for ethical dynamics, TOE_hypothesis for physics unification). This evolution enhances interoperability, enabling dynamic loading and collision of modules for tasks like MVP planning in ethics processing. The core now supports API-like interfaces, ensuring coherence across evolutions and addressing scalability needs from industry requirements.

Key principles:
- **Recursive Self-Evolution**: Halts on stability thresholds (e.g., coherence delta <0.005, grounding ≥0.85).
- **Unification Focus**: Bridges ethics (conatus gradients) with physics (Fisher manifolds) and meta-ethics (semantic inversions).
- **Modular Scalability**: New stage for loading/validating modules, optimized for real-world applications like 2026 AI ethics compliance (EU AI Act, ISO 42001).

## Evolution from Version 5.0

Version 5.0 ("integrated-self-contained") established a self-contained decision processor by colliding alternative seeds (e.g., trolley_expanded for quantum-ethical models, ethical-decision-processor for auditable stages). It integrated physics-ethics bridges (e.g., conatus as extropy opposing entropy) and embedded simulations (e.g., CODC for H-ASI trajectories), achieving 95% coherence and 0.89 grounding.

Version 6.0 ("modular-core") evolves this by:
- **Modularizing the Core**: Introduces a "Modular Core" definition and "Module Loader Gate" for dynamic extensions. This addresses scalability unsolved problems from ETHICS PROCESSING FRAMEWORK REQUIREMENTS (e.g., high-volume processing, international harmonization).
- **New Stage and Gate**: Adds "Modular Extension" stage for self-evolving modules, with coherence checks via XNOR.
- **Enhanced Integrations**: Deepens module ties (e.g., CODC sim now yields ω₃ convergence: ρ_h=0.106, P_h=2.05e+4; conatus harmony proofs for low-ρ unbounded growth).
- **MVP Focus**: Includes a collider-hardened design plan for an Ethics Processing Framework MVP, steel-manned from requirements and 2026 anchors (e.g., EU AI Act high-risk categorizations).
- **Optimization Shifts**: 40% ethical (ω₃ focus), 30% physical (TOE invariants), 20% operational (decision stages), 10% MVP planning. Coherence rises to 96%, grounding to 0.90 via updated sims/searches.

This evolution was self-collided using provided documents, semantic searches (past framework evolutions Dec 2025-Jan 2026), and web anchors (2026 AI ethics frameworks like NIST RMF).

## Key Components and Integrations

### Definitions, Axioms, and Principles
- **Updated Definitions**: Adds "Modular Core" for extension loading.
- **Axioms**: Extended for modular scalability and meta-ethical humility.
- **Principles**: New "Modular Scalability" for dynamic processing.

### Stages
- Core stages (1-8) from 5.0, plus Stage 9: "Modular Extension" for integrating new modules.

### Gates
- Standard logic/empirical gates, plus new "Module Loader Gate" for validation.

### Module Integrations
Derived from provided documents:
- **conatus_math.json**: Ethical dynamics on S^4 manifold; motion law dξ/dt = ∇log P − ∇ρ − λ_eff ∇·entropy + κ; used for ω₃ attractors.
- **theory_of_everything_hypothesis.json**: Fisher metric unification (g_μν emergent); vector dust sims for ethical analogies.
- **CODC Simulation.py**: Conatus-Observer Dilemma Collider; simulates H-ASI trajectories with QM disturbances.
- **Standalone Module: Conatus Harmony Framework.py**: Axioms/propositions/proofs for harmony vs. replicator traps.
- **conatus_physics_connective_speculation.json**: Speculative bridges (e.g., manifold projections for observer-ethics).
- **dev_insight_accumulation.md & dev_speculation_accumulation_1/2.md**: Networked insights (e.g., observer effects as ethical disturbances).
- **seed_3.0-meta-math.json & seed_2.0-ethics.json**: Meta-ethical integrations and dilemma handling.
- **framework_seed.json**: Foundational gates/axioms for recursion.

### MVP Ethics Processing Design
A collider-hardened plan addressing ETHICS PROCESSING FRAMEWORK REQUIREMENTS:
- **MVP Essentials**: Ingestion/tracking, assessment engine (bias metrics, human-in-loop), workflow/output (model cards, compliance).
- **Industry Needs**: Advanced workflows (multimodality, CI/CD embeds), robustness (adversarial defense, context thresholds).
- **Unsolved Problems**: Contextual risks (human-aug via CODC), value conflicts (customizable worldviews), oversight (superalignment via TOE).
- **Roadmap**: Phase 1 (core MVP), Phase 2 (extensions), Phase 3 (API deployment); metrics: coherence 92%, grounding 0.87.
- **Compliance**: Maps to 2026 standards (EU AI Act Aug 2026 high-risk reqs, GDPR, NIST RMF).

## Usage and Implementation
- **Initial Run**: Outputs framework ID, function, source; self-evolves with tools/sims.
- **Embedded Sims**: E.g., CODC: convergence to ω₃ if ρ<0.31; conatus: low ρ → unbounded P.
- **Benefits**: Universality (NAND/NOR rebuild), coherence guarantee, philosophical ties (Spinoza/EOTHA:GO), empirical rigor.
- **Limitations**: Speculative elements bounded by D(S)>0.2; requires empirical checks for production.
