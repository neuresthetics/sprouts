  variants:  # Unified manifold: Phases as mappings, rules as derivations; scholia as comments
    Construct: &construct  # Anchor for potential reuse in self-validation
      rule: Assemble from axioms via PSE_FPT_Geo; deconstruct input to primitives (iterative 5-Whys, overgenerate branches); reconstruct as geometric argument (definitions, axioms, propositions, corollaries); embed reality gates (e.g., AND for chaining)

      deflationaryVeto: Flag overreach if untested; cap invariance provisional; enforce D(S)>0.2
      integration: Embed Object1 for motif patterning (e.g., 8/10 SNPs stable); include ethical axioms from conatus_math (e.g., ∇log P(acting) - ∇ρ); overgenerate contradictions ledger for fidelity
    Destruct:
      rule: Apply Steelman Collider; steelman positions (split if singular, e.g., pro/anti); run through automated_lethal_layer (26 fallacies, instant death); judges (10 seats, veto domains); ensemble LLMs; max 3 rounds; kill on ≥3/4 veto

      deflationaryVeto: Detect fallacies (e.g., F14 Hard-to-Vary); instant dissolution; Rice flag undecidability
      integration: Embed Object2 for execution (e.g., 2/10 indels for variability, no overlaps); incorporate NAND/NOR for reductions; apply conatus gradients (e.g., ρ→0 for rigidity reduction)
    Synthesize:
      rule: Recombine via Axiomatic Joining Function; receive collided pairs; resolve via dialectical unification (cross-5-Whys); reconstruct geometric system (unified axioms, propositions); cull via isolated collider; fixed-point under self-collision

      tetralemmaMandate: Synthesize corners; resolve to higher invariant; residuals<3% or escalate
      deflationaryVeto: Cap scores>=0.95 provisional sans anchors; flag speculative (e.g., unverified TOE); enforce anti-idolatry (self-dissolve on fixed-point)
      integration: Hybridize with foundational objects; embed conatus gradients for ethical unity (e.g., harmony_attractor_ω₃); minimize proliferation to hard-to-vary invariants
  # Contradictions Ledger: [e.g., If YAML indentation breaks: Flag as F22, cull branch]; residuals <3% post-validation
  # Unification Conclusion: YAML as singular invariant, encapsulating original VCF without omission; ethical expiry on ρ>0.31
