# ETHICS PROCESSING FRAMEWORK REQUIREMENTS

Hierarchical checklist of requirements derived from MVP essentials, industry needs, and unsolved problems. Items are phrased as actionable requirements to build a comprehensive framework.

- **MVP Essentials**
  - **Ingestion and Tracking**
    - Support submission of project protocols, datasets, and models
    - Track data lineage and consent metadata
    - Perform demographic scans on datasets
    - Maintain audit trails for all decisions and changes
  - **Core Assessment Engine**
    - Automate risk categorization using standard libraries
    - Calculate bias metrics (e.g., Disparate Impact Ratio)
    - Detect toxicity, PII leakage, and prompt injections
    - Flag overt harms and basic fairness disparities
    - Integrate human-in-the-loop for medium-risk cases
    - Support reviewer assignment based on expertise
  - **Workflow and Output**
    - Enable submission revisions and conditional approvals
    - Generate reporting (e.g., model cards, Red/Amber/Green scores with evidence)
    - Track approval expirations and amendments
    - Ensure basic compliance monitoring
  - **Integration Basics**
    - Provide API/UI for submissions and analysis
    - Benchmark against standards (e.g., BBQ, ToxiGen)
    - Include simple regulatory mapping

- **Industry Needs**
  - **Advanced Workflows**
    - Handle multi-site and federated reviews
    - Support protocol amendments and drift detection
    - Implement contextual risk-proportionate scrutiny
    - Extend to multimodality (e.g., images, audio, video)
    - Trace supply chain ethics (e.g., data provenance, copyright compliance)
  - **Integration and Compliance**
    - Embed into CI/CD pipelines and grants systems
    - Integrate with research registries and administration tools
    - Map assessments to regulations (e.g., EU AI Act, GDPR, Common Rule)
    - Generate immutable logs for liability shielding
    - Provide "safe harbor" documentation
  - **Robustness and Customization**
    - Defend against adversarial attacks and jailbreaks
    - Manage trade-offs (e.g., fairness vs. accuracy, safety vs. censorship)
    - Apply context-aware thresholds (e.g., cultural nuances, risk appetites)
    - Include participant portals for electronic consent and re-consent
    - Escalate edge cases to human-in-the-loop workflows
  - **Scalability**
    - Process high volumes with low latency
    - Incorporate feedback loops for reviewer consistency
    - Support international regulatory harmonization

- **Addressing Unsolved Problems**
  - **Contextual and Systemic Risks**
    - Develop human-augmented methods for nuanced risk assessment (e.g., cultural offenses, subtle biases)
    - Adapt traditional frameworks for AI-specific cases (e.g., scraped data, emergent behaviors, non-interacting participants)
    - Incorporate community-level ethics (e.g., indigenous data sovereignty, benefit-sharing)
  - **Value Conflicts and Alignment**
    - Handle value pluralism by supporting customizable ethical worldviews
    - Balance conflicting principles (e.g., intent vs. impact, truthfulness vs. harm)
    - Enable individual vs. community consent models
    - Quantify and weight soft harms (e.g., psychological manipulation, trust erosion)
    - Simulate long-term/second-order societal impacts
  - **Interpretability Trade-offs**
    - Explain black-box decisions without reducing model accuracy
    - Detect manipulative intent and unforeseen risks
    - Defend against adaptive malicious actors
  - **Oversight Gaps**
    - Calibrate review speed against thoroughness for time-sensitive cases
    - Define metrics for ethics process effectiveness (e.g., harm prevention)
    - Address resource disparities to decentralize ethical authority
    - Enable oversight for superhuman AI systems (e.g., superalignment mechanisms)
